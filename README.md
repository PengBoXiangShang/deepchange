We contribute a large, realistic long-term person re-identification benchmark. It consists of **178K** bounding boxes from **1.1K** person identities, collected and constructed over a course of **12 months**. Unique characteristics of this dataset include: (1) Natural/native personal appearance (e.g., clothes and hair style) variations: The clothes-change and dressing styles are highly diverse, with the reappearing gap in time ranging from minutes, hours, and days to weeks, months, seasons, and years. (2) Diverse walks of life: Persons across a wide range of ages and professions appear in different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, extremely cold) and events (e.g., working, leisure, daily activities). (3) Rich camera setups: The raw videos were recorded by 17 outdoor security cameras with various resolutions operating in a real-world surveillance system for a wide and dense block. (4) Largest scale: It covers the largest number of (**17**) cameras, (**1121**) identities, and (**178407**) bounding boxes, as compared to alternative datasets.
